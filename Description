As agriculture struggles to support the rapidly growing global population, plant disease reduces the production and quality of food, fiber and biofuel crops. Farmers spend billions of dollars on disease management, often without adequate technical support, resulting in poor disease control. So, we came up with a solution, Data Delivery Drones. These autonomous drones scan whole fields for any plant diseases using powerful deep learning models running on the cloud and inform the farmers accordingly, providing them with the suggestions on how treat them.
Converting drones into data drones. Data drones are the ones collecting data, of anything and sending it to cloud for processing it to get the required information and sending signals to delivery drones to drop the required items. Technologies used are - IoT (Internet of Things): For equipping the drone with the required sensors and devices to collect raw data and sample. Cloud: On which raw data will be sent and processed. CNN: Data will be converted into information (filtration will be done). NLP: Communicate with people nearby drone or giving real-time feed. Web Technology, Automation etc.
